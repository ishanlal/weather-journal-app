# Weather Journal App Project

## Overview
This project creates an asynchronous web app that uses Web API from OpenWeatherAPI and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Description
A server was created in `server.js` and web client was created in `website/app.js`. `index.html` was used to bind interactivity of Javascript and update UI elements dynamically.

## Instructions

1. Run the `server.js` file in the terminal or command line window. Before running make sure your machine has Node.js, express, cors, and body-parser packages installed.

1. Open a web browser and go to: `localhost:8080`. Fill in a US zip code, how you are feeling in the text prompt and hit the Generate button.

1. In the most recent entry prompt you should see updated UI elements showing today's date, the temperature in Kelvins and the how you're feeling prompt.
